From smartphones to smart wearables, from finding information to buying things, from banking to healthcare, from listening to music to driving a car, every aspect of our life is impacted by computers. This trend will only accelerate with the new age of AI and Machine Learning. The future belongs to nations who can make fundamental advances in Computer Science.</p>
                  <p class="text-justify">To ensure that the brightest minds in the world get an opportunity to study Computer Science, leaders from Silicon Valley, top American and European institutions, industry leaders, and venture capitalists have come together to build a new University focussed on Computer Science - Sitare University. The first Sitare batch was started in 2022 with twenty four students, and the second batch admitted in 2023 has forty four students. We plan to admit around one hundred students in 2024, and gradually increase this number to around one thousand admissions per year in 2030. Sitare students are selected based upon their JEE mains performance, as well as an interview.</p>
